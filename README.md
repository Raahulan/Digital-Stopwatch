FPGA Digital Stopwatch using XSCHEM + Open-source tools
# Digital Stopwatch (FPGA Project)

This repository presents the complete design and implementation of a **Digital Stopwatch**
using **open-source FPGA tools**. The project covers the full digital design flow starting
from RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and ending with **clock tree synthesis (CTS)**,
**place and route (PnR)**, and **physical verification**.

This work was carried out for academic learning purposes and demonstrates practical
FPGA/ASIC-style digital design using open-source EDA tools.
